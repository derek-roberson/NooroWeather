#  ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Build a weather app that demonstrates your skills in Swift, SwiftUI, and clean architecture. The app should allow users to search for a city, display its weather on the home screen, and persist the selected city across launches. Follow the Figma designs closely and integrate data from [WeatherAPI](WeatherAPI.com).
# ðŸ”­ Scope

### Home Screen:

- Displays weather for a single saved city, including:
	- City name
	- Temperature.
	- Weather condition (with corresponding icon from the API).
	- Humidity (%).
	- UV index.
	- "Feels like" temperature.
- If no city is saved, prompt the user to search.
- Search bar for querying new cities.

###  Search Behavior:

- Show a search result card for the queried city.
- Tapping the result updates the Home Screen with the cityâ€™s weather and persists the selection.

###  Local Storage:

- Use UserDefaults (or equivalent) to persist the selected city.
- Reload the cityâ€™s weather on app launch.

### API Integration

- Use WeatherAPI.com to fetch weather data:
	- API Documentation: [WeatherAPI Documentation](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/).
	- Free tier includes current weather data with:
		- Temperature.
		- Weather condition (including an icon URL).
		- Humidity (%).
		- UV index.
		- Feels like temperature.

#  ðŸ¤” Assumptions/Context

There is no requirement to display both temperature units so Fahrenheit was chosen.

# âœ… Possible Approaches

#### Search Behavior:

1. Trigger search on submit
	-  Simpler
	- Single API Call
1. Search while typing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">(***Winning Option***)</mark>
	- Requires multiple API calls
		- Search/Autocomplete then Current
		- In order to be efficient, the Current Weather API calls should happen in parallel if there are multiple cities

# ðŸš« Out of Scope

- Full scope of unit testing is out of scope. A single one was added to show the testing capabilities of the code base. It should be straightforward to add to the suite.
- Caching support for images
- More elegant error handling
